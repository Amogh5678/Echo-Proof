## Understanding Decentralized Streaming

### What Is Decentralized Streaming?

Decentralized streaming delivers real-time audio and video without centralized servers. Unlike platforms like Zoom or Google Meet, which rely on proprietary data centers, decentralized streaming uses peer-to-peer (P2P) protocols and distributed infrastructure (media nodes) to relay streams. This enhances privacy, censorship resistance, scalability, and enables token-incentivized participation.

#### Why Decentralized Streaming Matters

- **Privacy:** No central entity controls user data.
- **Censorship Resistance:** Streams are resilient to shutdowns.
- **Cost Efficiency:** P2P and distributed nodes reduce infrastructure costs.
- **Incentivization:** Node operators and users earn tokens.
- **Scalability:** Distributed systems handle traffic spikes better than centralized servers.

## Core Technology Stack for Decentralized Streaming

### WebRTC: The Foundation

WebRTC (Web Real-Time Communication) is an open-source protocol enabling P2P audio, video, and data transfer in browsers. It's the cornerstone of decentralized streaming.

**Key Components:**
- **MediaStream:** Captures audio/video from devices (e.g., webcam, microphone).
- **RTCPeerConnection:** Establishes P2P connections for streaming.
- **RTCDataChannel:** Sends non-media data (e.g., chat, metadata).

**Advantages:**
- No plugins required; works natively in browsers.
- Low-latency communication.
- Built-in encryption (DTLS for signaling, SRTP for media).

**Challenges:**
- NAT traversal requires STUN/TURN servers for connectivity behind firewalls.
- P2P struggles with large groups due to bandwidth demands.

### Selective Forwarding Units (SFUs)

SFUs are servers (or nodes) that relay media streams to participants, addressing WebRTC's scaling limitations. Instead of each peer sending streams to all others, they send to an SFU, which forwards only necessary streams.

**How SFUs Work:**
- Receive streams from all participants in a call.
- Forward relevant streams (e.g., active speaker's video) to each participant.
- Optimize bandwidth by sending lower-quality streams to non-active viewers.

**Benefits:**
- Reduces client-side bandwidth (critical for mobile/low-bandwidth users).
- Supports large meetings (50+ participants).

> **Decentralized SFUs:** In Huddle01, SFUs are run as Distributed Media Nodes (DMNs) by the community.

### IPFS and Filecoin for Storage

- **IPFS (InterPlanetary File System):** A P2P protocol for storing and sharing files, used for stream recordings or metadata.
- **Filecoin:** A decentralized storage marketplace that incentivizes nodes to store data long-term.
- **Use Case:** Recordings are pinned to IPFS for decentralized access and optionally backed by Filecoin for persistence.

### Wallet-Based Access Control

- Users authenticate via crypto wallets (e.g., MetaMask, WalletConnect).
- **Token-Gated Rooms:** Access restricted to holders of specific tokens or NFTs, verified on-chain.
- **Implementation:** Smart contracts check wallet signatures or token balances.

### Encryption with Lit Protocol

- **Lit Protocol:** A decentralized key management network for encrypting streams and controlling access.
- **Functionality:** Encrypts media streams with conditions (e.g., token ownership) to ensure only authorized users can decrypt.
- **Advantage:** End-to-end security without relying on a central authority.

### Smart Contracts for Payments

- **Purpose:** Automate node operator rewards, staking, and penalties.
- **Platforms:** Deployed on Ethereum, Polygon, or other EVM-compatible chains.
- **Mechanics:** Operators stake tokens to join, earn rewards for uptime/bandwidth, and face slashing for misbehavior.

## Distributed Media Nodes (DMNs) in Depth

### What Are DMNs?

DMNs are community-run SFUs in Huddle01's network that relay WebRTC streams. They replace centralized servers, making the system resilient, scalable, and community-driven.

### Technical Architecture

- **Node Software:** Built on SFU frameworks like Pion, Ion-SFU, or LiveKit.
- **Requirements:**
  - High-bandwidth internet (100 Mbps+ symmetric).
  - Stable uptime (99.9% target).
  - Modern CPU (4+ cores) and GPU for stream processing.
  - 8 GB+ RAM, SSD storage.
- **Discovery:** Nodes register via a decentralized protocol (e.g., libp2p, Distributed Hash Table).
- **Routing:** Streams are routed to the nearest or least-loaded DMN based on latency, geographic proximity, and capacity.

### Incentive Mechanisms

- **Staking:** Operators lock tokens (e.g., HUDL) to join, ensuring commitment.
- **Rewards:** Earned in HUDL tokens based on:
  - Bandwidth provided (e.g., GBs relayed).
  - Uptime percentage.
  - Number of streams handled.
- **Slashing:** Penalties for downtime, malicious behavior, or low performance.

> Example: A node relaying 1 TB of traffic with 99% uptime might earn 5 HUDL/day.

### Why DMNs Are Game-Changing

- **Decentralization:** No single point of failure or control.
- **Economic Opportunity:** Anyone with hardware can earn tokens.
- **Scalability:** More nodes increase network capacity.
- **Community Ownership:** Aligns incentives between users and operators.

   import { HuddleClient } from '@huddle01/react';
   const huddleClient = new HuddleClient({ projectId: 'YOUR_PROJECT_ID' });
   ```
3. **Create a Room:**
   ```js
   const room = await huddleClient.createRoom({ token: 'YOUR_TOKEN' });
   ```
4. **Join Room with Wallet:**
   ```js
   await huddleClient.joinRoom({ roomId: room.id, wallet: 'metamask' });
   ```
5. **Add Token-Gating:**
   ```js
   await huddleClient.setAccessControl({
     roomId: room.id,
     tokenAddress: '0x...',
     minBalance: '1'
   });
   ```

#### Limitations

- **No Custom DMNs:** You can't select or run specific media nodes for EchoProof.
- **No Custom Rewards:** Node operators earn HUDL, not EchoProof-specific tokens.
- **Dependency on Huddle01:** Streaming relies on their infrastructure.

## Building Your Own Decentralized Media Nodes

### Why Build Your Own Media Nodes?

Creating your own media nodes gives you full control over the streaming pipeline, allowing customization of routing, tokenomics, and branding. This is ideal for EchoProof if you want a sovereign, incentivized streaming network tailored to your ecosystem.

### How Data Is Streamed in a Decentralized Network

1. **Stream Initiation:**
   - A client (e.g., browser) captures audio/video via WebRTC's MediaStream API.
   - The client establishes an RTCPeerConnection to negotiate codecs, ICE candidates (for NAT traversal), and stream parameters.
2. **Stream Relay:**
   - The client sends its stream to a nearby media node (SFU) over WebRTC.
   - The SFU receives streams from all call participants and forwards only the necessary streams to each client (e.g., active speaker's video).
   - SFUs optimize bandwidth by adjusting stream quality based on client needs.
3. **Node Discovery:**
   - Nodes advertise their presence via a decentralized protocol (e.g., libp2p's DHT).
   - Clients select nodes based on latency, load, or geographic proximity.
4. **Storage (Optional):**
   - Streams can be recorded and pinned to IPFS for decentralized storage.
   - Filecoin ensures long-term persistence with incentivized storage nodes.
5. **Access Control and Encryption:**
   - Wallet-based authentication verifies user identity.
   - Lit Protocol encrypts streams, ensuring only authorized users can decrypt.
6. **Incentives:**
   - Node operators stake tokens to join the network.
   - Smart contracts track uptime, bandwidth, and stream quality to distribute rewards.
   - Slashing penalizes poor performance or malicious behavior.

#### Who Will the Nodes Stream To?

- **Clients:** End-users (e.g., EchoProof users in a video call) connect to nodes to send/receive streams.
- **Other Nodes:** Nodes may relay streams to other nodes for load balancing or geographic optimization.
- **Applications:** Your app (EchoProof) integrates with nodes via an SDK or custom API to manage streams.

### Step-by-Step Guide to Building Media Nodes

Below is a detailed guide to setting up a decentralized media node using open-source tools.

#### 1. Choose an SFU Framework

Select a WebRTC SFU framework to handle stream relaying:

- **Ion-SFU:** Lightweight, Go-based, ideal for custom integrations.
- **LiveKit:** Feature-rich, TypeScript-based, with built-in SDKs.
- **Pion:** Pure Go WebRTC library for building custom SFUs.

> **Recommendation:** Use Ion-SFU for simplicity and performance.

#### 2. Set Up a VPS

**Requirements:**
- 4 vCPUs, 8 GB RAM, 100 GB SSD.
- 100 Mbps+ symmetric internet.
- Ubuntu 20.04+ (or similar Linux distro).

**Providers:** AWS, DigitalOcean, Hetzner, or Linode.
**Cost:** ~$20–50/month for a suitable VPS.

#### 3. Install and Configure Ion-SFU

```bash
# Install Go
sudo apt update
sudo apt install golang

# Clone Ion-SFU
git clone https://github.com/pion/ion-sfu
cd ion-sfu

# Build
go build ./cmd/sfu

# Create config file (config.toml)
cat << EOF > config.toml
[sfu]
bind = "0.0.0.0:7000"
webrtc_port_min = 50000
webrtc_port_max = 51000
[log]
level = "info"
EOF

# Run SFU
./sfu -c config.toml
```

#### 4. Set Up Peer Discovery with libp2p

Use libp2p for decentralized node discovery:

```bash
# Install Go libp2p
go get github.com/libp2p/go-libp2p

# Example: Create a libp2p node
cat << EOF > node.go
package main
import (
    "context"
    "fmt"
    "github.com/libp2p/go-libp2p"
    "github.com/libp2p/go-libp2p/core/host"
)
func main() {
    ctx := context.Background()
    node, err := libp2p.New()
    if err != nil {
        panic(err)
    }
    fmt.Println("Node ID:", node.ID())
    fmt.Println("Addresses:", node.Addrs())
    select {} // Keep node running
}
EOF

# Run node
go run node.go
```

#### 5. Deploy Smart Contracts for Incentives

Create a Solidity contract for staking and rewards:

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract MediaNodeRewards {
    mapping(address => uint256) public stakes;
    mapping(address => uint256) public rewards;
    
    event Staked(address indexed node, uint256 amount);
    event Rewarded(address indexed node, uint256 amount);
    
    // Stake tokens to join network
    function stake() external payable {
        stakes[msg.sender] += msg.value;
        emit Staked(msg.sender, msg.value);
    }
    
    // Reward nodes for uptime/bandwidth
    function reward(address node, uint256 amount) external {
        require(msg.sender == address(this), "Only contract can reward");
        rewards[node] += amount;
        payable(node).transfer(amount);
        emit Rewarded(node, amount);
    }
    
    // Slashing for downtime
    function slash(address node, uint256 amount) external {
        require(stakes[node] >= amount, "Insufficient stake");
        stakes[node] -= amount;
    }
}
```

- Deploy on Polygon or Ethereum testnet using Hardhat/Remix.
- Fund the contract with your token for rewards.

#### 6. Integrate with EchoProof

- **Client-Side SDK:** Build a WebRTC client using JavaScript:

```js
const pc = new RTCPeerConnection();
navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia({ video: true, audio: true })
    .then(stream => {
        stream.getTracks().forEach(track => pc.addTrack(track, stream));
        // Signal to SFU via WebSocket or libp2p
    });
```

- **API Layer:** Create an API to connect clients to your nodes:

```js
const express = require('express');
const app = express();
app.get('/nodes', (req, res) => {
    // Return list of active nodes from libp2p DHT
    res.json([{ id: 'node1', addr: '192.168.1.1:7000' }]);
});
app.listen(3000);
```

#### 7. Monitor and Optimize

- **Metrics:** Use Prometheus/Grafana to track:
  - Uptime.
  - Bandwidth usage.
  - Stream latency and jitter.
- **Scaling:** Add more nodes as demand grows.
- **Security:** Implement DDoS protection (e.g., Cloudflare) and monitor for Sybil attacks.

#### Challenges

- **NAT Traversal:** Set up STUN/TURN servers (e.g., coturn) for connectivity.
- **Performance:** Optimize SFU for low latency and high throughput.
- **Security:** Protect against stream hijacking and node spoofing.
- **Tokenomics:** Design a sustainable reward model to attract operators.

#### Pros

- Full control over streaming pipeline.
- Custom tokenomics for EchoProof's ecosystem.
- Potential to launch a DePIN protocol.

#### Cons

- High complexity (networking, WebRTC, blockchain expertise).
- Significant costs (VPS, development, audits).
- Time-intensive (3–6 months for production).
